            {"option": "B) Aisle Seat: I don’t want to squeeze past multiple people just to go to the toilet…\nYou like easy access to move around when needed, even if it means less comfort, more into lower risks.", "score": 2},
            {"option": "C) Middle Seat: Neither here nor there but at least I get both the convenience of going to the toilet and also the view of the sky! And at least I’m surrounded by my friends on both sides!", "score": 3},

            {"option": "C) Let’s see what the rest orders first and maybe we can share the different meals with each other!", "score": 3},
            {"option": "D) Hmmm let’s get something with fruits, vegetables and meat in it. I’ll maybe go for something nutritious and practical since we don’t know what food choices we have available when we touch down.", "score": 6},

            {"option": "D) That’s such a good deal! We’ll definitely spend the money anyways, let’s exchange a larger amount now so we can take advantage of the rate!", "score": 5},
            {"option": "E) Check what everyone else is doing first—if they’re exchanging, I’ll go along with it.", "score": 3},
            {"option": "F) There may be more exchangers near our resort! We can research along the way about the best times and locations to exchange currency, so we can get both value and convenience.", "score": 6},

            {"option": "C) Fantastic! A little adventure won’t hurt—I’ll enjoy it but I’ll stay mindful of what’s not included in the package.", "score": 4},
            {"option": "D) Definitely yes! It’s outside of PEEK resort so it should be reliable! Also I’ve heard of this travel agency before so it should be fine.", "score": 5},
            {"option": "E) What does the rest think? I don’t mind going for it, sounds fun! But if they aren’t interested I’m fine doing other activities as well.", "score": 3},
            {"option": "F) Hmmm, I’ll take the tour guide’s contact and take some time to research the package more to have a worth it memorable experience without any hidden charges!", "score": 6},

    {
        "question": "Scenario 9: There’s nothing like retail therapy\nSoon, it’s going to be your last day in Bali, and you’re on the hunt for souvenirs to bring back for your friends and family. The local market is bustling, and there are so many choices! What catches your eye?",
        "options": [
            {"option": "A) Let’s just mass buy these elephant pants or keychains so all my friends can get something each without having the need to compare!", "score": 2},
            {"option": "B) I think I’ll skip souvenirs and save my money. They’re nice to have, but not necessary, and I’d rather be safe than overspend.", "score": 1},
            {"option": "C) A mix of practical and fun items: maybe some handmade jewelry, a small bottle of Balinese spices, and a keychain for each friend. Something for everyone!", "score": 4},
            {"option": "D) Let’s go big! Let’s get rare items like elephant tusks, scarves, figurines, exotic coffee, and anything eye-catching that expresses that it’s from Bali.", "score": 5},
            {"option": "E) Maybe I’ll see what the locals or my family recommend, especially if there’s a popular item everyone’s buying. I want the trendiest souvenirs to give my friends!", "score": 3},
            {"option": "F) I’ll look for classic Balinese handicrafts—like wood carvings or batik cloth. Timeless, traditional, and meaningful and these will be high-quality keepsakes for my friends!", "score": 6},

            {"option": "E) I’ll ask my friends or family what they’re planning and go with the flow—spending time together is the most relaxing part.", "score": 3},
